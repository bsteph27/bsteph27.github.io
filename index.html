								<h3>Cloud Assessment - Petcube</h3>
								<p>Following the impacts of the Coronavirus (COVID-19), the Modern Datacenter worked with partners to develop a partner funded service offering to reengage with Clients. Through this, I assisted with the establishment of a Redapt Cloud Adoption Framework offering including the development of its engagement outline, determination of deliverables, and led 32 successful engagements over a 3-month period. This service performs an analysis on an existing cloud environment to provide organizations with the insight needed to better understand the current security posture, costs, and provide guidance towards improvement. This is a success story from one of these engagements as presented on the Redapt website.</p>
