								<h3>Azure Framework - Example</h3>
								<p>Well-Architected Framework is required to ensure a secure and scalable environment. This is a representation of an Azure Framework/Landing Zone design. For obvious reasons this is an example and not one that has been customized for a specific client.</p>

								<h3>Cloud Assessment - Petcube</h3>
								<p>Following the impacts of the Coronavirus (COVID-19), the Modern Datacenter worked with partners to develop a partner funded service offering to reengage with Clients. Through this, I assisted with the establishment of a Redapt Cloud Adoption Framework offering. This is a success story from one of these engagements as presented on the Redapt website.</p>
